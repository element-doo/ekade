This directory is being actively managed by DSL-Platform.

Any changes you do to the files inside directories will be LOST
because it regenerates all directories upon every change in the DSL.

You can place some files next to this README (such as .gitignore, .bzrignore, .svnignore, ..).
These, and other files in the platform root will not be modified.
